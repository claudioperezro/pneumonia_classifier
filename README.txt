Image Classification: Image Classification Using CNN to Detect classify patients with pneumonia and healthy patients. 

This Repository contains a project whose aim is to train, tune and evaluate a model that will learn to classify x-ray images of patients with pneumonia and healthy patients. The project can be found in the Jupyter notebook found in the repository.

The project explores 4 different models, all of which have a different motivation and process behind them which ultimately led to the best model, which reached a test accuracy of 90%.  


This repository contains the following files and directories:

- pneumonia_neural_networks.ipynb

Contains the project as a Jupyter notebook.

- Data/chest_xray

Contains all of the images used for this project. It is then divided into different folders containing the pictures used for training, testing and validation. 

- tuner

Contains files used by the model tuner. The tuner is used to optimize the parameters in some models.

- Image Classification using CNN Classifying X-rays.pdf

Contains a pdf of a slideshow presentation focused on showing results to potential stakeholders and further steps.
